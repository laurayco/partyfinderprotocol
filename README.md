# The Party Finder Protocols

## What is this document?
An attempt at squaring up the anti-social, time-wasting behavior on NA Party Finder. It will be sorted into a few different categories: PF Leader, PF Pre-Fills, PF Fills, All Players, Role-Specific expectations.
Obviously the entire point of this document is to suggest a common set of expectations and behaviors so it will be opinionated, but will strive to avoid opinions on game balance and what to do if eg: Summoner has really low performance, or what iLvl expectations are appropriate.
It is not meant to be exhaustive - no document outlining a social process ever can be - please ammend as suits your needs but bare in mind that this document (if it serves its purpose) will be the starting reference point for NA PF.

## How can I contribute?
Open a pull request with any revisions you would make to the document. Discussion on the merits of your pull request can be mediated in the PR discussion. This should be a living document.

## What are the consequences for betraying these expectations?
You will probably be blacklisted by people depending on how annoying your behavior is.

## Social Roles and Expectations
### Party Finder Leader
You should know in advance how many pre-fills you have (ie: people you invite to the party before starting PF). If you know someone else will be later joining the party, make sure to mention that in the description.
Your description should include any strats used and the prog-point of the least progressed member of your party including pre-fills.

If you want a specific composition, you need to set that up *every time you start searching for fills*.

You need to pay attention to what causes wipes during pulls.
If someone is consistently wiping before the prog-point advertised in the description, mention you will be kicking someone and then pull out of the raid and kick them. You don't need to be rude about this, a simple
`"Due to consistent issues reaching the prog point, we will be kicking <problem player> and re-filling."` is sufficient. After the player is kicked, ask if anybody remaining wishes to leave and wait for 10s of no
response. Once that 10s is up, re-list the party finder. Additionally, consider blacklisting the kicked player so that they cannot re-join the party finder immediately.

Ideally, though, this is a party-wide responsibility and *help* and **constructive** criticism
should be offered before kicking. However, you do not want to waste 7 people's time on the behalf of 1 person who overestimated their prog point. Be at your keyboard and answer any questions that are DM'd to you so
that you can help people know if your PF is right for them.

**IF YOU ARE USING "PASTEBIN STRATS" THEN YOU NEED TO HAVE A LINK TO THE PASTEBIN AVAILABLE.**
**IF YOU ARE USING "PASTEBIN STRATS" THEN YOU NEED TO HAVE A LINK TO THE PASTEBIN AVAILABLE.**

**IF YOU ARE USING "PASTEBIN STRATS" THEN YOU NEED TO HAVE A LINK TO THE PASTEBIN AVAILABLE.**
**IF YOU ARE USING "PASTEBIN STRATS" THEN YOU NEED TO HAVE A LINK TO THE PASTEBIN AVAILABLE.**

The listing should also mention max Loot Wanted (By restricting to reward unclaimed players so that PF search will work as intended). This also includes what loot you may want to reserve for pre-fill members (though,
in that case I suggest utilizing the loot master feature available in raid finder and tagging this appropriately in the PF description).

A lot of this may not fit in the PF description ; in that case utilize copy & paste for when someone new joins the party so that if the additional information causes them to no longer want to join they can leave and
you can get someone else asap.

#### Party Finder Pre-Fills
Show up on time. Pay attention to the PF entry to make sure the leader didn't accidentally mess up the listing.

With that out of the way, pay attention to the strats listed in the PF. If they mention strats you do not know or do not want to learn, then do not join! If there are no PFs available with your preferred strats,
there are two appropriate courses of action: ask around in the PF listings if anybody has a reference for you to learn the mentioned strats, or creeate your own PF with the strats you are familiar with.

Do not join a savage (or Extreme/Unreal/Ultimate) fight PF while undergeared. "Undergeared" in this scenario means anything with a lower iLvl than the best available crafted (HQ) gear that launched with the savage tier.
Ideally your gear will also be pentamelded, you will have at least one piece of tome gear, and food and pots available but the bare minimum is the crafted HQ gear that launched with the tier.
On that note, whatever gear you have, make sure you can kill the stone sea sky dummy for the fight you are targeting.

When someone is kicked for bad performance or anti-social behavior, do not bail immediately! Wait for the PF lead to kick the offending party (and leave of your own volition if you are specifically raiding with
the offending party.)

### All Players
If you cause a wipe: speak up! If you do not know why you caused a wipe, you can ask for help from the people who agreed to help you prog (or clear) the fight. If you know why you caused the fight, you can
apologize, and reassure the group that you know what mistake you made and avoid getting kicked and keep the 7 other people *who agreed to help you* from having to sit in party finder for your replacement.

Know your job. In normal content you can mostly dig in your butt and faceroll your hotbar with 1 GCD per minute and still clear. In savage, that is less so the case. Please know how to play your job effectively.
You should know your rotation, your burst window, buff target priorities, AOE vs Single Target skills, cooldown use, etc. There really isn't a reason that you should be octuple weaving in savage.

*Be honest*. Do not lie about your prog point (either directly or by joining a PF you shouldn't or by creating a PF you shouldn't.)
*Be patient*. There is always going to be a variance in skill in this game that can't be accounted for with social etiquette. Criticism should seek to be constructive, rather than tear people down.

Really the point here is to rehabilitate the general social skills of the NA Party Finder, as they are deteriorated to the point that it is causing a lot of issues. Imposing on seven strangers your need
to be carried in a fight is anti-social behavior. Similarly, denigrating a stranger because they are not as progressed or reliable in a fight is also anti-social behavior. Please be considerate of others.

Avoid asking about or speaking of any third party tools (Dalamud Plugins or Parsing utilities). These do break ToS and while this document has no opinion on the usage of them, discussion of them in game
is contentious and can lead to disciplinary action from GMs.

### Role-Specific expectations

Broadly, standard compositions for extreme+ difficulty content is: 2 tanks, 2 healers, 2 melee DPS, 1 physical ranged DPS and 1 casting DPS. The following will be written with that standard in place
with some suggested modifications to apply on an as-needed basis.

Standard clock spots:

```
R1 MT R2
H1 && H2
M1 OT M2
```

### Light Parties
Light parties are tied to a healer (either H1 or H2).

Light party one (LP1) will consist of: H1, MT, M1, R1

Light party two (LP2) will consist of: H2, OT, M2, R2

#### Tanks
"Main Tank" (MT) Refers to the first tank that has aggro in the fight. If a fight has multiple bosses that are aggro'd separately, talk to each other to decide who will main tank. "Off tank" (OT) is the other tank.
While not holding aggro, use short cooldown skills (Heart of Corundum, TBN, etc) on the tank with aggro when a non-shared tankbuster is appearing. Alternate uses of reprisal, where off tank uses reprisal first.
Know how and when to use shirk and provoke to faciliate tank swaps as neeed - this will be fight-specific knowledge. When you die and get raised, provoke as soon as safe so that you are first or second in aggro,
otherwise if / when the other tank will die this will cause a DPS to hold aggro and will quickly cause issues for your healer. While you hold aggro, your clock spot is north. While you do not hold aggro your 
clock spot is south, but your light party assignments do not change (unless fight-specific mechanics or strats demand it specifically).

#### Healers
Most of the time you will probably have a shield healer (SGE or SCH) and a regen healer (AST or WHM). H1 should be your shield healer and H2 should be your regen healer. In the event that you have
two shield healers or two regen healers, H1 is assigned according to the following priority: SGE SCH AST WHM. If you have two healers on the same job reconsider this, otherwise the healer with higher HP takes H1.

If you use a raising macro, less is more. Avoid clogging comms with useless noise. A simple `/p raising <t> <se.1>` is sufficient. No need for a quip about owing 2400 MP, shaming them for dying, or other things.
Keep your communication during a pull intentional.

#### Melee DPS
Melee DPS jobs assign priority to M1 in the following order: DRG, NIN, MNK, RPR, SAM, VPR

Alternate uses of feint for raid-wide damage, starting with M1. Do try to hit your positionals when you can, but do not risk a wipe to do so. Be familiar with when you need to use true north.

#### Ranged DPS
Magical jobs will get R1 and physical jobs will get R2. If you have two magical or two physical, assign R1 with the following priority: PCT, BLM, SMN, RDM, DNC, MCH, BRD

Use your raid-wide mitigation on the highest value raid-wide you can. Your healers may have specific areas they may want you to use your mitigation. Most raid-wides deal magical damage,
so it is helpful to keep addle on cooldown. The physical ranged mitigation is more flexible, and it all overwrites each other (shield samba/troubador/tactician). If you have two physical ranged dps,
alternate your raidwide mitigation in a similar manner as melee DPS alternate feint uses (and magical DPS do the same with addle.)

# Addendums

## Three ranged players
If one of them is a RDM, have the RDM pretend to be a melee player. If there are no RDMs, but there is a SMN, assign SMN to a melee position. These two jobs benefit from melee uptime for the enchanted melee combo and ifrit skills respectively.
Otherwise, prioritize players who have progged the fight on a melee job to avoid muscle-memory mishaps.

## Three melee players
Assign the most comfortable person to the ranged position that is not occupied.

# Closing notes

By setting these expectations you will save time by:
- not needing to establish clock spots every time you enter a fight. this document does it for you ahead of time.
- minimizes time waste due to bad faith actors (aka "Prog Liars")
- minimizes time waste due to miscommunication (strats are communicated, freely available)
- avoids having to build a completely new party because one person out of eight was not meeting expectations

Please share this github far and wide so that party finder is more usable for all of us. If you feel something in this document needs expounding or revision, please submit a pull request with the changes using the built-in editor on github.
